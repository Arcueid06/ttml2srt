1
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:06,280
Why didn't you ask me? I know a million theater jokes.

2
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:08,280
What's the deal with those guys down in the pit?

3
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:10,360
-They're musicians. That's not a joke.
-It's a funny observation.

4
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:14,040
Severance package.
The Yankees are giving me three months full pay for doing nothing.

5
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,720
They did it for three years. What's another few months.

6
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:18,560
I'm really going to do something with these three months.

7
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,640
Like what?

8
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:33,480
I'm gonna read a book. From beginning to end.
In that order.

9
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:36,560
I've always wanted to do that

10
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:40,200
I'm gonna play frolf.
You mean golf?

11
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,840
Frolf, frisbee golf Jerry.
Golf with a frisbee.

12
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,480
Time to taste the fruits and let the juices drip down my chin.

13
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:18,880
I proclaim this: The Summer of George!
