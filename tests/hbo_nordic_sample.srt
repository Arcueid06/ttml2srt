1
00:00:00,291 --> 00:00:02,083
Why didn't you ask me? I know a million theater jokes.

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:04,875
What's the deal with those guys down in the pit?

3
00:00:05,041 --> 00:00:08,875
-They're musicians. That's not a joke.
-It's a funny observation.

4
00:00:09,041 --> 00:00:10,792
Severance package.
The Yankees are giving me three months full pay for doing nothing.

5
00:00:10,959 --> 00:00:15,375
They did it for three years. What's another few months.

6
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:18,875
I'm really going to do something with these three months.

7
00:00:20,542 --> 00:00:23,875
Like what?

8
00:00:24,041 --> 00:00:28,041
I'm gonna read a book. From beginning to end.
In that order.

9
00:00:28,208 --> 00:00:33,625
I've always wanted to do that

10
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:52,125
I'm gonna play frolf.
You mean golf?

11
00:00:52,291 --> 00:00:53,125
Frolf, frisbee golf Jerry.
Golf with a frisbee.

12
00:00:54,291 --> 00:00:55,125
Time to taste the fruits and let the juices drip down my chin.

13
00:00:56,291 --> 00:00:57,125
I proclaim this: The Summer of George!
