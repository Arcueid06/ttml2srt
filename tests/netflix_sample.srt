1
00:00:06,131 --> 00:00:07,465
Why didn't you ask me? I know a million theater jokes.

2
00:00:07,549 --> 00:00:08,550
What's the deal with those guys down in the pit?

3
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:09,884
-They're musicians. That's not a joke.
-It's a funny observation.

4
00:00:09,968 --> 00:00:13,096
Severance package.
The Yankees are giving me three months full pay for doing nothing.

5
00:00:13,179 --> 00:00:14,472
They did it for three years. What's another few months.

6
00:00:14,556 --> 00:00:17,183
I'm really going to do something with these three months.

7
00:00:17,267 --> 00:00:18,810
Like what?

8
00:00:20,353 --> 00:00:21,730
I'm gonna read a book. From beginning to end.
In that order.

9
00:00:21,813 --> 00:00:24,983
I've always wanted to do that

10
00:00:25,066 --> 00:00:27,569
I'm gonna play frolf.
You mean golf?

11
00:00:27,652 --> 00:00:30,196
Frolf, frisbee golf Jerry.
Golf with a frisbee.

12
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:33,283
Time to taste the fruits and let the juices drip down my chin.

13
00:00:33,366 --> 00:00:34,826
I proclaim this: The Summer of George!
